## Supported versions of IntelliJ

| Plugin Version | IntelliJ Versions |
| :--- | :--- |
| future version | ?? |
| 1.13.1 | 2017.1.* - 2017.3.* |
| 1.13 | 2017.1.* - 2017.2.* |
| 1.12 | 2017.1 - 2017.1.5 |
| 1.11 | 2016.3 - 2016.3.* |

JetBrains create downloadable releases with or without a bundled JRE. If you download a release without a bundled JRE you will need to have a JRE installed. Since IntelliJ 16 (the 2016.* versions) JRE 8 is required to run the IDE.

## A few caveats, etc.

This is an early stage work in progress. The feature set is likely lacking in many areas: refactoring support, debugging and the full reference support that provides go to declaration and go to implementation etc. There are certainly more.

This plugin is being developed for IntelliJ IDEA however it should be able to work in other Jetbrains IDE's including CLion (although you may need to compile from source with a few minor code changes). We do intend to support CLion in a future release.

This plugin is being developed purely by a few volunteers in their spare time – unless someone can provide some better funded resource to work on this. It is a project that will span years not weeks. Please support the project by using the plugin and feeding back your experiences by raising issues for feedback, feature requests and bugs. Even better get involved and submit pull requests.

## Latest Updates

* September 2017 - Released v1.13.1 to add support for IntelliJ 2017.3 and fix various bugs
* July 2017 - Released v1.13 to add support for IntelliJ 2017.2 and remove the need for DCD
* March 2017 – Released v1.12 to add compatibility with IntelliJ 2017.1 (#139)
* December 2016 – v1.11 of the plugin adds compatibility with IntelliJ 2016.3

## Installation

[Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and install IntelliJ Community Edition (Free) or Ultimate (Paid)
From IntelliJ go to Preferences > Plugins > Browse Repositories and search For "D Language" (**you will see 2 plugins, Choose the DLanguage one**) then click install and restart IntelliJ

You can also download the plugin jar to your local disk directly from the [Jetbrains plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8115?pr=) and then in IntelliJ go to Preferences > Plugins > Install plugin from disk and choose the jar you downloaded

## Quick Usage

### Import an existing DUB project

If you have an existing dub project you can import it via File > Import Project

![Import](https://github.com/intellij-dlanguage/intellij-dlanguage/raw/master/.README/import-dub-project.png)

### New Project with DUB

When you select this to create a new project with dub, if dub is on your path, it will attempt to use _dub init_ to create a new dub project for you. If dub is not on your path it will create a source directory and you will have to create your sdl/json dub file manually or rename/delete the source folder and then use _dub init_ to recreate it. Alternatively you can open an existing dub project by doing: File -> Open

Once a dub project is loaded there is right click menu option to run with dub, or you can use the run config
– run with Dub.


Before running go and configure the DTools in Preferences -> Other Settings -> D Tools.

### Basic DUB Dependency Support

There is very basic dub dependency support via Tools > Process D Libraries

It reads the dub dependencies and loads the libraries into the External Libraries

  ![Dub  Dependency](https://github.com/intellij-dlanguage/intellij-dlanguage/raw/master/.README/process-d-libs.png)

#### Basic D-Unit Test Runner Support

If you add the d-unit dependency to your dub.json [d-unit](http://code.dlang.org/packages/d-unit) and then run Process D Libraries you will be able to run d-unit tests

  ![Test Support](https://github.com/intellij-dlanguage/intellij-dlanguage/raw/master/.README/d-unit-support.png)

### Configure DTools

The best option is to do and get the following tools and build them according to their GitHub page instructions:

 * [dub](http://code.dlang.org/download)
 * [DCD](https://github.com/Hackerpilot/DCD)
 * [DScanner](https://github.com/Hackerpilot/Dscanner)
 * [Dfmt](https://github.com/Hackerpilot/dfmt)

If you put these tools on your path you can go to Preferences -> Other Settings -> D Tools and just click autofind on each of the tools and it will find them. Otherwise you will need to select the correct path to the tool for each one.

There is a nice blog post about setting up the tools at: [www.samael.me.uk](http://www.samael.me.uk/2015/12/d-plugin-for-intellij-idea.html)

### Configuring DCD

To configure DCD in the dcd-server add a comma separated list of paths that point to your libraries that you want to include in autocompletion.

For example:

        /Library/D/dmd/src/phobos,/Library/D/dmd/src/druntime/import,/Users/hendriki/.dub/packages/rainbow-master/src

This will add the phobos and druntime/import as well as my rainbow dub project. You can add other dub packages by adding the path to them. I should be able to autoconfigure this stuff in a future release.

**UPDATE**: all project files are now automatically added to DCD and if on MacOS/OSX/macOS the D sources are also added automatically. The position on Linux and Windows is not currently clear since this work was done on OSX.

### DCD Server Restart Action

I noticed that after a while the auto completion seemed to cause the editor to hang. As a first step I have added a menu action in Tools as the last option to Restart the DCD Server. This action will just kill the running process and restart it again which seems to fix the hanging issue. I will investigate further to find a way to prevent the hanging in the first place but this is a helpful restart action.

### DFormat

To reformat D code use the shortcut or the menu item - Code -> Reformat Code with D Format (ctrl+alt+K) or on mac (cmd+alt+K)

### DFix

To apply DFix to the a file use the shortcut or the menu item - Code -> Fix D code with DFi (ctrl+alt+M) or on mac (cmd+alt+M)

### Syntax Highlighting

Go to Preferences -> Editor -> Colors and Fonts -> D File

You can customize the syntax highlighting colours here. Save as a new theme - and then untick the inherit from checkbox and this will allow you to choose a colour for each item. Only the native items will show as changing in the code example. From function definition downwards the options are related to annotated highlighting which is based on the grammar and not the lexer. So these don't show as changing the code example but they do work.

also see this document for getting the environment setup: [plugin development](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/PluginDevelopment)

this one is also helpful: [make a plugin in less than 30 mins](http://bjorn.tipling.com/how-to-make-an-intellij-idea-plugin-in-30-minutes)

### Setup

The project uses Gradle with the [gradle-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin). Simply use the Gradle wrapper in the root of the project to build the plugin using the following:

```bash
./gradlew buildPlugin
```

You can also use the plugin to boot up a stand alone instance of IntelliJ with the plugin installed using:

```bash
./gradlew runIde
```
